1] Intro - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. With HTML we can create our own Website.It describes the structure of a Web page. Easy to Learn. It consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

HTML Document - Simple.html & Syntax.html .

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

2] Editors - 
Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
We can use any other editor like Sublime text, VS code, etc..

1] Intro 



2] What is Website & How to Create?  -->
Website is nothing but when we type to search anything on internet(Firefox, chrome, etc..) with url(uniform resource loader) - https://www.google.com, so browser sends requests to server & if it matches it will send the data/response to client otherwise it will send that page not found, But whatever we will see the result/webpage had been created by HTML, Bcoz HTML is a parent/root for web applications.



3] How HTML CSS & JS Work? [eg. car] --> For responsive & better User experience/interfaces we need CSS & JS with HTML. HTML, CSS, JS[Building Block of development].
HTML - define the structure & display information/content which we will see in web page.
CSS - Used to make website looks good/amazing in styling purposes.
With HTML & CSS we can only create static website[static - only readable content].
JS - We can add logic/functionality in JS. Used to create dynamic website & make user more friendly.
With help of HTML, CSS and JS we will be like frontend developers.
CMS(content management system)/dynamic - HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL.
We think that HTML is easy but its very important bcoz if we don't have any content only then there is no use of CSS and JS.

Static website - A static website is the simplest website that’s embedded with HTML codes with no customized coding and dynamic features. Having a static website does not require the user to use server-side scripting, only client-side scripting such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.

Dynamic website - A CMS website is also known as a dynamic website that contains pages that are characterized by changing contents that would be more operational, something the viewers are able to interact with, than just reading it. Designing a CMS website would need more than client-side scripting, it’ll need a server-side scripting language like ASP, PHP, JavaScript, JSP, ColdFusion, etc. When the viewer accesses a CMS website, the codes are separated and divided on the web server and the final HTML page is shown on the client’s web browser. To simplify, a CMS website is a combination of a server-side scripting and a client-side scripting specifically an e-commerce site and social media site.



4] what is HTML?  --> HTML[Hypertext Markup Language].
Its not a programming language, its a markup language. Markup means it deals with tags.



5] VS Code Editor & Folder Structure  --> We can write code in atom, bracket, sublime text, notepad, but we will use VS Code Editor. 
Tip 1 -> HTML extension .html/.htm[it is used in old days, bcoz extension was supporting only 3 characters at that time].
Tip 2 -> File name must be index.html bcoz it's a default path of of our home page/root of our website.
Tip 3 -> Use - https://www.google.com/     OR   https://www.google.com/index.html.    
Both will give same output but now browser are more modern so no need to write index.html in url.
But when we had to access any other page like about us, contact, ...etc we had to write that particular path in url/web address so it can show that page, by default we will see only index.html page.



6] How to Code HTML  --> <h1> Best HTML Course </h1>

<h1> Best HTML Course </h1>  - The whole thing is called as elements.

1] WHY JS =>

JS improves the user experience of web page by converting it from static webpage to dynamic webpage/interactive one. OR JS adds behavior to webpages.

How websites work => frontend/backend Or client/server 
Frontend => HTML/HTML5(structure/what to display), CSS/CSS3(we can make more decorative), JS(we can make more interactive by having dynamic interface).

We can make static pages by only HTML & CSS, but for dynamic we need JS(which can be used as frontend - React & Angular/backend - Node).

We can work on JS in browser everywhere by using console.
alert("hello world!"); console.log("Hello world!");

VS Code editor. Extension - Babel JS.

We had to run js in terminal use node (node <filename>);

1st we were consoling in browser but with the help of vs we can do console in teerminal also.
